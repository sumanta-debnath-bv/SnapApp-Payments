            LLC ("BlueVector AI") and the entity or person agreeing to these terms ("Customer") and govern Customer's
            access to and use of the Services.
            This Agreement is effective when Customer either accepts it as part of creating, installing or using a
            Customer Application, or otherwise agrees to this Agreement (the "Effective Date"). If you are accepting on
            behalf of Customer, you represent and warrant that (i) you have full legal authority to bind Customer to
            this Agreement; (ii) you have read and understand this Agreement; and (iii) you agree, on behalf of
            Customer, to this Agreement.

            <br />
            <strong>Services Use.</strong> During the Term, BlueVector AI will provide the Services in accordance with

            <br />
            <u>To the Services.</u>
            <br />
            BlueVector AI may make commercially reasonable updates to the Services from time to time. BlueVector AI will
            inform Customer if BlueVector AI makes a material change to the Services that has a material impact on
            Customer's use of the Services.
            <br />
            <br />
            <u>To the Agreement.</u>
            <br />
            BlueVector AI may make changes to this Agreement, including pricing (and any linked documents) from time to
            time. Unless otherwise noted by BlueVector AI, material changes to the Agreement will become effective 30
            days after they are posted, except to the extent the changes apply to new functionality in which case they
            will be effective immediately. If Customer does not agree to the revised Agreement, Customer may stop using
            the Services. Customer may also terminate this Agreement for convenience under Section 8.4 (Termination for
            Convenience). Customer's continued use of the Services after such material change will constitute Customer's
            consent to such changes. BlueVector AI will post any modification to this Agreement to <a

            with applicable law, applicable regulation, court order, or guidance issued by a governmental regulator or
            agency, where such change is expressly permitted by the Data Processing and Security Terms, or where such
            change: (a)is commercially reasonable; (b)does not result in a degradation of the overall security of the
            Services; (c) does not expand the scope of or remove any restrictions on BlueVector AI's processing of
            Customer Personal Data, as described in the Scope of Processing Section of the Data Processing and Security
            Terms; and (d)does not otherwise have a material adverse impact on Customer's rights under the Data
            Processing and Security Terms.
            If BlueVector AI makes a material change to the Data Processing and Security Terms in accordance with this
            Section, BlueVector AI will post the modification to the URL containing those terms.
            <br />

            <strong><u>Software.</u></strong>
            <br />
            BlueVector AI may make Software (which may include third-party software) available to Customer. BlueVector
            AI grants Customer a royalty-free (unless otherwise stated by BlueVector AI), non-exclusive,
            non-transferable license during the Term to reproduce and use the Software for the purposes of making a
            Customer Application available to End Users, and may impose additional licensing restrictions with notice to
            Customer. Any export, reexport, transfer, or use by Customer of the Software is subject to this Agreement
            (including the restrictions and compliance obligations it imposes with respect to use of the Services, all
            of which will apply to the Software), and may also be subject to third-party license terms and requirements
            under Export Control Laws. As between the parties, BlueVector AI retains all Intellectual Property Rights in
            the Software. Each party represents and warrants that it will comply with all laws and regulations
            applicable to its provision or use of the Software, as applicable. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED FOR IN THE
            AGREEMENT, THE SNAPAPP SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR
            REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY KIND.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong><u>Data Processing and Security Terms.</u></strong>
            <br />
            The Data Processing and Security Terms are incorporated by this reference into the Agreement.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong><u>Free Accounts.</u></strong>
            <br />
            Free accounts, including free trials, are subject to limitations, are not eligible for Technical Support and
            certain features of the Services may not be available for free accounts. BlueVector AI's indemnity does not
            apply to use of the Services under a free account.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong><u>End Users and Customer Applications.</u></strong>
            <br />
            BlueVector AI is not responsible for the content, accuracy or reliability of Customer Applications or
            Customer Data. Customer's use of Customer Applications or Customer Data is entirely at Customer's own risk
            and is governed by any agreement, terms or other relationship between the creator of the Customer
            Application and End Users.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong><u>Pre-GA Features.</u></strong>
            <br />
            BlueVector AI may make available to Customer pre-general availability features of the Services or Software
            that are identified as "Early Access," "Alpha," "Beta," "Preview," "Private Preview," "Experimental," or a
            similar designation (collectively, "Pre-GA Features"). PRE-GA FEATURES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT ANY
            EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY KIND. Pre-GA Features (a) may be changed, suspended
            or discontinued at any time without prior notice to Customer and (b) are not covered by any BlueVector AI
            indemnity. Except as otherwise expressly indicated in a written notice or the documentation for a given
            Pre-GA Feature, (i) Pre-GA Features may not be covered by Technical Support and (ii) the Data Processing and
            Security Terms do not apply to Pre-GA Features and Customer should not use Pre-GA Features to process
            personal data or other data subject to legal or regulatory compliance requirements. With respect to Pre-GA
            Features, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, neither BlueVector AI nor its suppliers will be
            liable for any amounts in excess of the lesser of (A) the limitation on the amount of liability stated in
            the Agreement or (B) $1,000. Nothing in the preceding sentence will affect the remaining terms of the
            Agreement relating to liability (including any specific exclusions from any limitation of liability). Either
            party may terminate Customer's use of a Pre-GA Feature at any time with written notice to the other party.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong><u>Payment Terms.</u></strong>
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Payment</strong>
            <br />
            <strong>Online Billing.</strong> At the beginning of the applicable Fee Accrual Period or as otherwise
            stated by BlueVector AI in the Settings Pages, BlueVector AI will issue an electronic bill in advance to
            Customer for all charges based on Customer's subscription plan for the Services during the applicable Fee
            Accrual Period (including, if applicable, the relevant Fees for Technical Support). Customer will pay all
            Fees in the currency stated in the invoice. If Customer elects to pay by credit card, debit card, or other
            non-invoiced form of payment, BlueVector AI will charge (and Customer will pay) all Fees immediately at the
            beginning of the Fee Accrual Period. If Customer elects to pay by invoice (and BlueVector AI agrees), all
            Fees are due as stated in the invoice. Customer's obligation to pay all Fees is non-cancellable. BlueVector
            AI will not issue refunds or credits for partial periods of Services. BlueVector AI's measurement of
            Customer's use of the Services is final. BlueVector AI has no obligation to provide multiple bills. Payments
            made via wire transfer must include the bank information provided by BlueVector AI.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong><u>Taxes.</u></strong>
            <br />
            Customer is responsible for any Taxes, and Customer will pay BlueVector AI for the Services without any
            reduction for Taxes. If BlueVector AI is obligated to collect or pay Taxes, the Taxes will be invoiced to
            Customer and Customer will pay such Taxes to BlueVector AI in addition to the Fees, unless Customer provides
            BlueVector AI with a timely and valid tax exemption certificate.
            <br />
            If required under applicable law, Customer will provide BlueVector AI with applicable tax identification
            information that BlueVector AI may require to ensure its compliance with applicable tax regulations and
            authorities in applicable jurisdictions. Customer will be liable to pay (or reimburse BlueVector AI for) any
            taxes, interest, penalties, or fines arising out of any mis-declaration by Customer.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong><u>Invoice Disputes &amp; Refunds.</u></strong> Any invoice disputes must be submitted before the
            payment due date. If the parties determine that certain billing inaccuracies are attributable to BlueVector
            AI, BlueVector AI will not issue a corrected invoice, but will instead issue a credit memo specifying the
            incorrect amount in the affected invoice. If the disputed invoice has not yet been paid, BlueVector AI will
            apply the credit memo amount to the disputed invoice and Customer will be responsible for paying the
            resulting net balance due on that invoice. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Customer waives all
            claims relating to Fees unless claimed within 60 days after the invoice date. Refunds (if any) are at
            BlueVector AI's discretion and will only be in the form of credit for the Services. Nothing in this
            Agreement obligates BlueVector AI to extend credit to any party.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong><u>Delinquent Payments; Suspension.</u></strong> Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5%
            per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) from the payment due date until paid in full.
            Customer will be responsible for all reasonable expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by BlueVector
            AI in collecting such delinquent amounts. If Customer is late on payment for the Services, BlueVector AI may
            Suspend the Services or terminate the Agreement for breach under Section 8.2 (Termination for Breach).
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong><u>No Purchase Order Number Required.</u></strong> Customer is obligated to pay all applicable Fees
            without any requirement for BlueVector AI to provide a purchase order number on BlueVector AI's invoice (or
            otherwise).
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong><u>Customer Obligations</u></strong>
            <br />
            <br />
            <u>Compliance.</u> Customer will (a) ensure that Customer and End Users' use of the Services complies with
            the Agreement, (b) use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent and terminate any unauthorized use of, or
            access to, the Services, and (c) promptly notify BlueVector AI of any unauthorized use of, or access to, the
            Services, Account, or Customer's password of which Customer becomes aware. BlueVector AI reserves the right
            to investigate any potential violation of the AUP by Customer, which may include reviewing Customer
            Applications or Customer Data.
            <br />
            <br />
            <u>Privacy.</u> Customer is responsible for any consents and notices required to permit (a) Customer's use
            and receipt of the Services and (b) BlueVector AI's accessing, storing, and processing of data provided by
            Customer (including Customer Data, if applicable) under the Agreement.
            <br />
            <br />
            <u>Restrictions.</u> Customer will not, and will not allow End Users to, (a) copy, modify, or create a
            derivative work of the Services; (b) reverse engineer, decompile, translate, disassemble, or otherwise
            attempt to extract any or all of the source code of the Services (except to the extent such restriction is
            expressly prohibited by applicable law); (c) sell, resell, sublicense, transfer, or distribute any or all of
            the Services; or (d) access or use the Services (i) for High Risk Activities; (ii) in violation of the AUP;
            (iii) in a manner intended to avoid incurring Fees (including creating multiple Customer Applications or
            Accounts to simulate or act as a single Customer Application or Account (respectively)) or to circumvent
            Service-specific usage limits or quotas; (iv) to engage in cryptocurrency mining without BlueVector AI's
            prior written approval; (v) to operate or enable any telecommunications service or in connection with any
            Customer Application that allows End Users to place calls or to receive calls from any public switched
            telephone network; (vi) for materials or activities that are subject to the International Traffic in Arms
            Regulations (ITAR) maintained by the United States Department of State; (vii) in a manner that breaches, or
            causes the breach of, Export Control Laws; or (viii) to transmit, store, or process health information
            subject to United States HIPAA regulations except as permitted by an executed HIPAA BAA.
            <br />
            <br />
            <u>Documentation.</u> BlueVector AI may provide Documentation for Customer's use of the Services.
            <br />
            <br />
            <u>Copyright.</u> BlueVector AI provides information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual
            property online, but BlueVector AI cannot determine whether something is being used legally without input
            from the copyright holders. BlueVector AI will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and may
            terminate repeat infringers in appropriate circumstances as required to maintain safe harbor for online
            service providers under the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Any information or notifications
            regarding copyright concerns should be sent to <a

            <br />
            <br />
            <strong><u>Suspension.</u></strong>
            <br />
            <br />
            <u>AUP Violations.</u> If BlueVector AI becomes aware that Customer's or any End User's use of the Services
            violates the AUP, BlueVector AI will give Customer notice of the violation by requesting that Customer
            correct the violation. If Customer fails to correct the violation within 24 hours of BlueVector AI's
            request, then BlueVector AI may Suspend all or part of Customer's use of the Services until the violation is
            corrected.
            <br />
            <br />
            <u>Other Suspension.</u> Notwithstanding Section 4.1 (AUP Violations), BlueVector AI may immediately Suspend
            all or part of Customer's use of the Services if (a) BlueVector AI believes Customer's or any End User's use
            of the Services could adversely impact the Services, other customers' or their end users' use of the
            Services, or the BlueVector AI network or servers used to provide the Services; (b) there is suspected
            unauthorized third-party access to the Services; (c) BlueVector AI believes it is required to Suspend
            immediately to comply with applicable law; or (d) Customer is in breach of Section 3.3 (Restrictions).
            BlueVector AI will lift any such Suspension when the circumstances giving rise to the Suspension have been
            resolved. At Customer's request, unless prohibited by applicable law, BlueVector AI will notify Customer of
            the basis for the Suspension as soon as is reasonably possible.
